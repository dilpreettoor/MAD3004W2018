1.Difference between tuple and dictionary 

A. tuple can contain return multiple values(predefined) of different datatypes whereas in dictionary you can only store values of one datatype but can have any number of pairs.
Dictionary requires key but in tuple you wont need any key.

2. Dictionary
var address = [String:AnyObject]()
address["street"] = "265 yorkland blvd" as AnyObject
address["area"] = "North York" as AnyObject
address["postal code"] = "M1H1Y1" as AnyObject

var person = [String:AnyObject]()
person["firstname"] = "HP" as AnyObject
person["lastname"] = "Patel" as AnyObject
person["age"] = 50 as AnyObject
person["address"] = details as AnyObject
person["total amount"] = 2000 as AnyObject



3.Factorial of a number
func factorial(a: Int) -> Int
{
    if N == 1
    {
        return 1
    } else {
        return a * factorial(a - 1)
    }
}
var result = factorial(a: 10)
print(result)
